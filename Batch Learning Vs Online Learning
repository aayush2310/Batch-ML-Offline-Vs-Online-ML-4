Production is basically the server on which our code is going to be run.

ML model behaves differently on the server.

Batch learning is the conventional way of training the ML model where we use the whole data to train the ML model.So generally the data is huge so if i train it on server 
then it is costly and time taking so it is done offline.

Then the model is put on production environment.

Problem:-The model has become static now,whatever it had learnt,it will not learn anything else,no evolution.


so,online learning is deployed.
